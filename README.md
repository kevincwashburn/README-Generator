# Readme Generator

![license-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-None-blue)

## Description
This program dynamically generates a readme markdown file based on the user’s input and GitHub information. The program prompts a series of questions in the terminal via  the ’inquirer’ dependency. It then retrieves data from the GitHub API via the ‘axios’ dependency to populate the generated file with the user’s profile picture. The user’s responses are displayed under their respective headings. Furthermore, a table of contents is conveniently displayed under the description for easy navigation.
